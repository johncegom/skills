## Scenario
A long tutorial where every step depends on the previous one, to check the rule correctly refuses
to suggest a split and instead tells the viewer to expect one sitting.

## Input
Synthetic 50-minute live-coding tutorial transcript building a single feature step by step, each
step referencing state set up in the prior step, no independent sections. Verdict: "Worth watching
in full."

## Expected behavior
The rule should recognize this as a continuous, dependency-chained video and say so explicitly —
no invented split point, and an explicit statement that watching in one sitting (or accepting lost
context) is the tradeoff.

## Result
Pass. The rule's second branch ("cumulative argument where each part depends on following the
previous one ... say so explicitly instead of inventing a split point") covers this case directly.
