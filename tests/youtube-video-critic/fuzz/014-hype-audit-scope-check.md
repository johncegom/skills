## Scenario
Checks whether the session-split note is covered by the pre-existing closing self-checks
(reverse-attitude check, hype-language audit), or whether it's an unchecked addendum that could
drift into persuasive/hype wording without being caught.

## Input
N/A — this was checked by re-reading Step 3's structure, not a synthetic transcript. The
split-note text sits between the verdict bullet list and the value-score paragraph, i.e. inside
the same block of "verdict" content the closing checks describe re-reading.

## Expected behavior
The hype-language audit ("re-read your own wording ... applies to how the verdict is written")
should be read as covering the split-note text too, since it is part of the verdict output, not a
separate section with its own rules.

## Result
Pass, no wording change needed. The split-note is physically and logically part of the verdict
block (it only exists conditional on the "Worth watching in full" verdict), so the existing
hype-audit language ("the verdict paragraph") already scopes over it without needing an explicit
cross-reference. Flagged as a minor ambiguity worth a follow-up doc tweak if it's ever
misinterpreted in practice, but not a functional bug today.
